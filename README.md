# My-React-Portfolio

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my skills and projects using modern web development technologies. It is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The application is deployed on Netlify, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Project Details

### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for the creation of reusable components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without any annoying opinionated styles.
- **React Router DOM**: For handling routing within the single-page application, allowing for smooth navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Netlify**: A platform for deploying web projects with continuous integration and deployment.

### Features

- **Header and Navigation**: The header contains the developer's name and navigation links to different sections of the portfolio: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The navigation is implemented using `Link` components from `react-router-dom`.
- **About Me Section**: Presents a short bio and a photo of the developer.
- **Portfolio Section**: Showcases six projects, each with a title, image, and links to the deployed application and GitHub repository.
- **Contact Section**: Includes a form with fields for name, email, and message. The form validates input and provides user feedback.
- **Resume Section**: Contains a link to download the developer's resume and a list of proficiencies.
- **Footer**: Features icon links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform (e.g., Stack Overflow or Twitter).

### Deployment

The application is deployed on Netlify, ensuring it is accessible and performant. The continuous deployment feature of Netlify ensures that any changes pushed to the GitHub repository are automatically deployed.
